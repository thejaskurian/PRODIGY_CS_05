# PRODIGY_CS_05

## Overview

This repository hosts a Python-based packet sniffer tool. The tool is designed to intercept and analyze network packets, offering insights into network traffic patterns. It provides detailed information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols used (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP), and payload data contents.

## Features

- **Packet Capture**: Captures network packets in real-time.
- **Packet Analysis**: Extracts and presents essential details from intercepted packets:
  - Source and Destination IP Addresses
  - Protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP)
  - Payload Data
  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Constantly monitors network traffic, updating the analysis dynamically.

## Requirements

To utilize this tool on Windows, ensure that npcap is installed. You can download npcap from the [official npcap site](https://nmap.org/npcap/).
